We rely on OpenCV for a lot of our image processing and feature tracking.
To use the CUDA frontend make sure you are building OpenCV from scratch.
To build with OpenCV you can run the following:

1. Clone the following
    - git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv
    - git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib
2. Change to OpenCV 3 since that is what ROS uses
    - cd opencv
    - git checkout 3.4.6
    - cd ../opencv_contrib/
    - git checkout 3.4.6
    - cd ..
2. Run cmake
    - cd opencv
    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules -DWITH_CUDA=ON ..
3. Make sure you can see some of the "contrib" and cuda modules (xfeature2d and cudafeatures2d)
4. Build and install
    - make -j8
    - sudo make install
5. OpenCV should now be installed system wide!
6. You will want to make sure your `/usr/local/cuda` points to the correct version that OpenCV built with
